DisCal is a full featured discord bot that manages a calendar and allows users to create, list, modify, delete, and announce events. 
<br> <br>
It was built to be powerful yet easy to use! 
Discord lacks a built in calendar, so we took the chance to make one for you! With DisCal, you can bring your Guild closer together by scheduling events and activities and having DisCal handle all of the hard work! 
<br> <br>
DisCal is perfect for every guild! Whether you are an RP Guild, Gaming Guild, or community Guild, DisCal was built to be versatile and unique! With DisCal no longer will you need to do any complex scheduling, DisCal handles all of that hard work for you!

DisCal is developed and maintained by NovaFox161.
