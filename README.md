DisCal is a discord bot that connects Discord and Google Calendar as seamlessly as possible with a wide feature set for calendar management and information.

# Core Features

* Powerful in-server integration of google calendar
* Custom Calendar creation and editing
* Event creation, editing, and deletion
* Automated announcement system to remind users of events
* Customizable prefix and mentionable commands
* Versatile and built for all communities
* Web dashboard for bot and calendar management

## Main Patron-Only Features

Patrons and supporters on the $5/month plans get access to work in progress and exclusive features.

* External Calendars
    - Use an already existing calendar that is on your Google account with DisCal
* Web Dashboard (WIP)
    - Use the web dashboard to manage the bot, calendar, and more without the need for commands.
    - Still very early in development
* Server Branding
    - Hide the DisCal name in favor of using your server's name on announcements and embeds.
* Announcement Publishing
    - Announcements posted in news channels can be (optionally) automatically "published" so servers following the news
      channel receive them as well!

### Smaller Patron-only Features

* Gif support for event images
* Automatically assign roles to users when RSVPing to an event.

## Planned Features & Work in Progress Changes

* Multiple calendars per server (WIP)
* Advanced announcement configuration (WIP)
* Complex recurring event configuration (WIP)
* Proper patreon integration for automated setup.
* Better translation support (Right now using the JSON files is really messy and hard to maintain)
* And so much more!
