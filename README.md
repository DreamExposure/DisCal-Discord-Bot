- **Everyone**
  - Everyone will always be able to access (unless commands are disabled for the channel)

# üóìÔ∏è Planned & Work In Progress
This bot is a hobby project for me, please note that while these features are planned, there's no solid timeline.
- Website rewrite (it's old and ugly)
- [WIP] Migration to Spring data
- [WIP] Kotlin coroutines rewrite

# üß∞ Tech stack
- Java 17
- [Discord4J](https://github.com/Discord4J/DIscord4J)
- Spring Boot (DI, Data, Actuator, etc.)
- Flyway for automatic database migrations (MySQL)
- Redis cluster caching
- Fully containerized with Docker (hosted in Kubernetes, docker-compose for local development)

# ‚úèÔ∏è Contributing
DisCal is an open source, GPL-3 project. We always welcome and appreciate contributions.

## üíª Development & Local Testing
For development, you need JDK 17+ and Docker installed.

1. Fork this repository and open it in your favorite editor (IntelliJ recommended for Kotlin)
2. Write your code and add applicable tests
3. Compile and build the docker image with `./gradlew clean jibDockerBuild`
4. Place config in `./docker/{api/bot/cam}/application.properties`
5. Start the bot and dependencies for testing with `docker compose up -d`
    - You can connect to the Java debugger at port `5005`
6. Create a pull request and describe your changes! <3

## üåê Localization & Internationalization
Please only submit localizations if you speak and/or write the language you are translating to.
We want to keep these translations correct and high quality, running the strings through Google Translate or DeepL is not acceptable.
Thank you for understanding

In the early days of the bot, we had a pretty dis-organized json file system for translated strings.
This was messy and somewhat confusing. Since the 2.0 update, we now utilize properties files

1. The base english locale file is located at `/src/main/resources/locale/values.properties`
2. Files are named `values_{lang-code}.properties`. For example, the Spanish locale file would be `values_es.properties`
3. Translate the strings and submit it back to us (either via Discord, or a pull request to this repo)

> **NOTE**: Variables use `{N}` where `N` is the zero-indexed order it is passed through in code.
>
> In English, these are always in order `0, 1, 2... 5`.
