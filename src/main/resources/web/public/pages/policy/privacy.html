				California Online Privacy Protection Act<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post
				a
				privacy
				policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United
				States
				(and
				conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from
				California
				consumers
				to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
				those
				individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at:
				http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:<br>
				<br>
				Users can visit our site anonymously.<br>
				<br>
				Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the
				first
				significant
				page after entering our website.<br>
				<br>
				Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:<br>

				<br>
				How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?<br>
				<br>
				We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track
				(DNT)
				browser
				mechanism is in place.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?<br>
				<br>
				It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking<br>

				<br>
				COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the
				Children's
				Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United
				States'
				consumer
				protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
				services
				must
				do to
				protect children's privacy and safety online.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				We market to<br>
				<br>
				We do not collect information from children under 13<br>

				<br>
				Fair Information Practices<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
				concepts
				they
				include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
				Understanding the
				Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the
				various
				privacy
				laws that protect personal information.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
				should
				a
				data
				breach occur:<br>
				<br>
				We will notify you via email<br>
				<br>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&bull;&#160;Within 7 business days<br>
				<br>
				We will notify the users via in-site notification<br>
				<br>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&bull;&#160;Within 7 business days<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to
				legally
				pursue
				enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
				requires
				not
				only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have
				recourse to
				courts or
				government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				CAN SPAM Act<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for
				commercial
				messages,
				gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough
				penalties
				for
				violations.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				We collect your email address in order to:<br>
				<br>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&bull;&#160;Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other
				requests or
				questions<br>
				<br>

				pertaining to
				orders.<br>
				<br>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&bull;&#160;Send you additional information related to your product
				and/or
				service<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:<br>

				reasonable
				way.<br>
				<br>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&bull;&#160;Include the physical address of our business or site
				headquarters.<br>
				<br>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&bull;&#160;Monitor third-party email marketing services for
				compliance,
				if
				one is
				used.<br>
				<br>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&bull;&#160;Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.<br>
